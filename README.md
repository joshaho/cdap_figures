# Streamlit Figure Generation Demo

This is a small figure-generation application leveraging [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) to take an excel template input and output a package of png images that are outside of the standard excel capabilities. 

This allows for a variety of use-cases including the repeatable production of figures for specific templated deliverables.
